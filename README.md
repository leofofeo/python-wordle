## How to use this app
1. Create your virtual environment, install the requirements, and run `python main.py` from root
2. Insert the known letters at the prompt a string (e.g., if you know `o` and `a` exist, type in `oa`)
3. Insert the letters you know don't exist at the prompt as a string
4. Insert known positions of letters in the following format: `_____`. For example, if you know the letters `o` and `a` exist, but the letter `a` is in the 3rd position, input `__a__`. Underscores should act as placeholders for unknown positions.
